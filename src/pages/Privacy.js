        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Your account data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and are
          never stored in plain text. Authentication sessions use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with short-lived
          access tokens and secure HTTP-only refresh cookies.

        <p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>

          display name and game statistics may be visible to other users on your public profile.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. You can delete your account at
          any time from your <a href="/account">Account Settings</a> page. When you delete your account, your
          personal data (email, display name, password hash) is permanently removed.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          We use a secure HTTP-only cookie for authentication refresh tokens. We do not use third-party
          tracking cookies or analytics services.
